        <data char="The character is here: [&#20013;]."
        >The character is here as decimal NCR: [&#20013;].

        <![CDATA[CDATA section is here: [&#x4E2D;].]]>
        The program should not convert these into a Chinese character.
        It should not convert the ampersand into an entity reference
        either.
        </data>

        name: <中 /><中 /><中 /></data>
